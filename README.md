## Description

Premier Pair-up is a football themed memory card game designed to test your knowledge of clubs and countries associated with football players. Inspired by my 6 year old son, who loves playing a football guessing game during his bath time. I created this game to bring the fun and challenge of that experience to a wider audience. Users can select from four different leagues or one international, making it a diverse and engaging experience for football fans of all ages.

## Features

* User Sign-up and Sign-In: Simple intuitive page for both new and previous users.
* Easy Navigation: Smooth and user-friendly navigation throughout the game.
* Crisp Card Images: High quality images of club badges that enhance the gameplay experience.

Upon selecting a leage, the user will see 16 facedown cards. The aim of the game is to turn the cards and match the pairs in as few sequences as possible.
