## Description

Premier Pair-up is a football themed memory card game designed to test your knowledge of clubs and countries associated with football players. Inspired by my 6 year old son, who loves playing a football guessing game during his bath time. I created this game to bring the fun and challenge of that experience to a wider audience. Users can select from four different leagues or one international, making it a diverse and engaging experience for football fans of all ages.

You can access the site at: https://messsy.github.io/Premier-Pair-Up/

## Features

* User Sign-up and Sign-In: Simple intuitive page for both new and previous users.

## Home Page

The landing page invites users to create an account in order to track their progress, however this function is not up and running. The navbar enables the user to select which of the four leagues or one international game that they would like to play.

## Game Pages

The user can select which of the leagues they wish to play;

* Premier League
* La Liga
* Serie A
* Rest of the World
* International

Upon selecting a leage, the user will see 16 facedown cards. The aim of the game is to turn the cards and match the pairs in as few sequences as possible.
